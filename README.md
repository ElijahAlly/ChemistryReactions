## Implementation Tips

### Frontend

#### TypeScript with Svelte

TypeScript gives you type safety for complex chemical models and reactions
React's component model works well for representing chemical elements and compounds
For visualizations, use:

- Three.js for 3D molecular modeling
- D3.js for reaction graphs and data visualization
- React-Three-Fiber if you want React bindings for Three.js

Svelte's advantages for your project:

- Much smaller bundle size for better performance when rendering complex chemical visualizations
- Simpler reactive programming model (less boilerplate than React)
- Better animation handling out of the box (important for smooth chemical reaction visualizations)
- SvelteKit gives you routing, SSR if needed, and excellent developer experience

### Backend

#### Python with FastApi

Excellent scientific computing ecosystem with libraries like:

- NumPy/SciPy for calculations
- RDKit for cheminformatics
- PyODE for physics simulations
- ChemPy for chemical equations and reactions

FastAPI would be ideal for this project. 
- It's more modern than Flask and lighter than Django, with built-in async support that will help with real-time calculations and streaming results. 

- Has automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Provides type checking via Pydantic models (pairs well with TypeScript)
- Offers better performance than Flask for calculation-heavy applications
- Has good WebSocket support for streaming reaction state changes

### Architecture

I recommend a decoupled architecture:

- Python backend API handling the chemical reaction calculations
- React frontend consuming the API and rendering visualizations
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates during reaction playbacks

### Database

- Use Supabase (PostgreSQL) for relational data
- Use Redis for caching and real-time updates

---

### Deployment

- Docker containers for both frontend and backend
- Consider serverless functions for calculation-heavy operations that might benefit from scaling
